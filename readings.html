<h1>Reading Reflections</h1>

<h2>Susan Sontag's On Photography</h2>

<p>The angle on truth, how we recognize what we perceive, and how we deliver the story through photography help me understand what should be remembered and excluded in photography. We humans have different viewpoints on life. People often argue about what is black and white, so how can we capture fragments and claim to show the whole truth? What if our truth is not theirs? Even after all these questions, we conclude that images can always be connected to something personal and find the way to each individual through their stories. Yet our angle can direct those thoughts into what we want them to see.</p>

<p>Our brains lose memories easily, but if documented in a photograph, they can stay with us forever. Yet, when we know that it’s only a fragment, “shadows,” and not reality itself, it reminded me of my class picture, where everyone was smiling at each other and looking delightful, but in fact, many of them despised each other. The image showed something that didn't exist between us. The distortion of reality in photography is an interesting paradox. In this case, we could take this image as an illusion of a happy class or a double-sided face, “masks,” that hide what they actually feel.</p>

<p>What’s the paradox behind always connecting to something personal while seeing an image? Everything we see in an image is real; however, we choose how we want to connect it to our lives. When you see a picture of someone frowning, you might connect that to your memory when you were annoyed by a text message, but the human in the image is frowning because of a sun ray. Does knowing the truth change how you perceive the image or how it made you feel initially? Rarely. Because what you felt was already in the past. If you look at the picture after knowing its whole backstory, it will create a new set of emotions. I love to be mysterious with my images, to leave a broad interpretation to the audience. I don’t curate the truth; I show the moments.</p>

<p>Knowing that each image is a part of a larger story is emotional. We create narratives one by one through single evidence. When I first held a camera in school, I couldn’t think of a plan. I just captured moments, and suddenly, when I looked at them, I saw a huge pattern. I saw a rhythm, and it was beautiful. This showed me how a single image can be turned into a narrative, similar to my future projects that will form a whole story. What I saw was the beginning of our identity and the actual pace of our lives.</p>

<p>In the modern world, we worry that artificiality has changed nature. As Sontag mentions, the oversaturation of images still carries a lot of meaning. There’s so much we can tell and address through photography. And yes, it is personal and powerful, which can distort and connect. I picture daily life and its complexity; I use text and images to bring my ideas to life, and I hope to build a deeper way of representing the world.</p>

<h2>With 'AI slop' distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster by Nesrine Malik</h2>

<p>The article I will be talking about is “With 'Al slop' distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster” by Nesrine Malik, which clearly portrays today’s struggles with AI and human relationships through images: fake, AI-generated images, and real images. The confusion is immersive. I chose this article because struggles around AI are becoming more and more relevant, especially regarding content consumption. We have to evaluate images we see on the internet critically more than ever.</p>

<p>The problem is that we don’t often question what we see online. We scroll, we react, and we barely analyze whether what we see is real or not. Malik talks about images, but it’s not only about images; it’s about everything. It made me think about my media habits as well.</p>

<p>Malik’s concept of blurred reality is unfortunately relatable. I used to be able to distinguish AI and real images a few months ago, but now, it’s getting more difficult. Some aesthetic pictures look very real, but they are AI. They might be shown as blurred old footage to make it look real, but in reality, it’s all fake. People around me, including myself, start to doubt the media, affecting how I consume news.</p>

<p>The interesting, but dangerous lenses of using AI come from political platforms. Different parties use AI to promote themselves by creating fake images of opposing parties, and most people believe it. In Georgia, they have an election in October. I have been seeing advertisements of one political party, using AI clips of people bashing other parties and praising their own, just for the sake of promotion. Even if I know that’s fake, I know someone will think it’s real, and it’s scary to think about how they can trick the human mind.</p>

<p>The AI stereotypes that Malik mentioned made me think about the agenda they are pushing: flawless-looking women and traditional families. I see those types of images on Instagram (meta) a lot, and they remind me that technology is never neutral because it’s powered by humans.</p>

<p>Her point regarding how platforms don’t care about truth is also relevant. Why do we often see low-effort content? As Malik described, the cheaper the content, the more profit the platform will earn. So what does that make us? Products that are being sold.</p>

<p>The consequence of all of these is total numbness. As Malik mentioned, we are sleepwalking into disaster. When I see content of war and political images integrated with meme-powered AI, I don’t react and scroll past, when I would have reacted differently to it before. My mind is overloaded and overwhelmed by all of the content I’m consuming, and sometimes, I feel like we are all becoming zombies.</p>

<p>This reading wasn’t just about AI but also about how we react to media. It reminded me that it’s very important to stop and reevaluate what we see on the internet before accepting it. This article connects to media literacy and how we should think critically before allowing it to distort our reality.</p>

<h2>Heela: The schoolgirl ‘My stolen future.’</h2>

<p>Photography and illustration can be close to each other, but they create very different moods. Illustrations create a warm, nostalgic feeling that gets close to you. For example, in animations, facial expressions are exaggerated to introduce emotions with clarity; they almost feel like flashbacks, while photography can be too literal. Photography is good for documentary, but it might still be unreadable to viewers since facial expressions are sometimes too subtle. For today’s reflection, I chose the story of Heela: The schoolgirl ‘My stolen future.’ The content of this piece is very harsh and sad. Even though a few real photos are integrated into the story, it still manages to share the episode without exposing others' faces so that we can project ourselves into each person’s shoes. This is one girl’s story, but things like that happen all the time.</p>

<p>Illustrations soften hard reality. If the story included authentic images, it might have been unbearable for readers to continue reading. Illustrations allow us to stand next to Heela and observe and feel her story; psychologically, when you observe illustrations, you get closer to the experience. There are scenes where the story gets heavier, and illustrations, without graphically showing each detail, portray the storyline with accuracy. They communicate fear and loneliness by using posture and shadow.</p>

<p>When we see the transition into real photography, our perception shifts. It shows a balanced integration of memory and present reality. We can see the difference between the illustration's warm tones and the real pictures' cold tones. The lighting in the photo puts us in the real room and reminds us that this all happened to a real person. In illustrations, people have softer edges, which portray them as symbols, while the real photographs have weight and texture.</p>

<p>When presenting a story, it’s always essential to understand the audience who will be reading it. If they read the story without illustrations, it would be understandable. Still, people would move on without fully processing what they just read. Suppose they had read the story with real documentation and photographs. In that case, they might have looked away even before finishing it because it would have been too harsh to face that reality, but with illustrations, it would have created understanding and connection with the reader. The nostalgia from observing illustrations is part of the bridge between distance and empathy. Little speech bubbles on each page help process the story better. It almost feels like you are reading a comic. The conclusion of the story appears on a black screen that creates stillness and silence, where you can let the breath out. It doesn’t need an illustration; the final part ends with a positive note and shows a ray of hope within the text.</p>

<p>In conclusion, illustration is used with stories to make them relatable and recognizable. It doesn’t soften the truth, but it makes the reader get closer to the story, while photography just tells you that this happened, and it’s up to you to recognize it.</p><nav>
