<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>When thinking about the concept and shapes, I decided on the mystical and haunted realm of the forest, the Appalachian mountains.The illustration I created is called a protection sigil. It can have different shapes, but I chose arrows. I used the pen tool in Adobe Illustrator to draw two straight strokes and cross them. At the end of the lines, I added triangular shapes. At the point where the lines cross each other, I added a small circle with the ellipse tool. This added a ceremonial look, which is an actual protection symbol.

After finishing the illustration, I opened the misty Appalachian forest image in Photoshop,(pinterest), placed my sigil on top of it as a smart object, and multiplied it. I lowered the opacity and blended the sigils within trees with soft light.</p>

<p>Sigils hold spiritual meaning, so I wanted them to blend into nature itself. This symbol takes you to places you never thought it would, just as the forest does. There’s always something deep and mysterious about forests, maybe because of their darkness or silence, but when you hear stories from primary witnesses, you think, what if it’s all true?

People living near the Appalachian mountains have rules, and travelers are always warned about them. With this illustration, I wanted to suggest that land is actively guarded, ancient, and always watching. This repetition of the crossed arrows almost creates a visible boundary. It warns us to be aware and maybe think twice when entering the premises. It definitely captures the eerie feeling of Appalachian folklore that says, "You are welcome to walk here, but you are not alone."</p>
