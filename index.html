<h1>Lenka Z</h1>

<div class="about">
    <p>Lenka Z is a Georgian artist and content creator who immigrated to America to pursue her career in TV and Film. Her singing journey opened doors into Georgian media, such as Got Talent and The Voice, where she fell in love with television and decided to pursue media studies.</p>

    <p>As her artistic path expanded beyond performance, Lenka explored her love of content creation through audio storytelling. She films analog-style videos and records her voice to tell a story through poetry. Her focus is mainly on life, relationships, and the human mind, where inspiration can come from anything: a new movie, book, series, a news story, her friendships, and even strangers on the streets. She also experiments with photography that captures spontaneous scenery, exploring dark and light themes.</p>

    <p>Lenka balances her performance with media work, including sound, image, and storytelling. She also creates short clips that include horror themes of human nature, that is often layered with well-known music tracks. Her media content can be found on her TikTok page, Lenka.Dormiveglia.</p>

    <p>Lenka admires the complexity of life and believes that every color it shows can serve as a canvas for her artistic journey, guiding her toward her dreams in filmmaking and directing.</p>
