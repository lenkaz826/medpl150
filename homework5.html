    <h2>Reflection</h2>

    <div class="reflection">
        <p>I created a broken peace symbol for my Photomontage. The broken peace illusion is commonly used in protests, webpages, and artworks that oppose false harmony. The design represents both personal and collective unrest. Russia has occupied 20% of Georgia and is now in an ongoing war with Ukraine. When I came up with this concept, I thought about how dictators mostly watch war victims rather than prevent their suffering.</p>

        <p>I used the Ellipse Tool in Adobe Illustrator to create a circle, then the Line Segment Tool. I created one line and then multiplied it to draw lines within the circle. After creating the symbol, I added deformed knots with the Curvature Tool to represent it as a deformed peace symbol. I used two identical knots by creating one shape, copying, pasting, and adding another knot in the middle of the symbol.</p>

        <p>These knots represent the border boundaries that were created in Georgian territories to prevent people from crossing. After completing the symbol shape, I opened my photomontage image in Photoshop, placed my symbol on top of it as a Smart Object, and multiplied it. I placed three broken peace symbols across the image and lowered the opacity to give the feeling that they were merging within the image. The middle image became one of the most famous images from the 2008 Georgian War, so the broken peace symbol is amplified specifically in that image. However, the other two symbols are placed on the sides of the text. Finally, I added the text on top of the photomontage that states “Russia is an occupant.”</p>
