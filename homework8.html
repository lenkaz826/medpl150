<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>For the first GIF, I had to use a new eye illustration to create the animation in Adobe Photoshop, and with a 0.1-second delay, I created a more realistic version of an eye blinking. I had nine eye illustration layers in Adobe Photoshop, which showed the eyes in multiple states during blinking. When I aligned each layer, I opened the timeline panel and started working on controlling the sequence and timing of each frame. I tried three versions of the duration, but in the end, I chose 0.1 seconds to make the blink look natural. This animation exercise was my first, and I had so much fun with it.</p>

<p>For the next GIF, I used an image of a kitten. I found a picture with a plain background on the internet. I opened the image in Photoshop, removed the background, converted it into a smart object, and duplicated the layers with different paw motions that I created using the Puppet Warp tool. Initially, I placed my points on the paw only, but it distorted the entire image. So, I added some points to the lower parts of the image as well, and then it worked well. I wanted to create a simple paw wave illusion, so I opened my layers in the timeline panel and played with the durations. In this case, the best option was to avoid a delay, making the GIF more playful.</p>
