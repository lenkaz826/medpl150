<h1>Homework 1</h1>

<img src="image1.jpg">

<p>The photos I chose for today depict the rhythm of life. Life can be chaotic and still, simultaneously, depending on when and how we capture the moment. Do people always face whatâ€™s before them, or are they constantly running away? When you see a human moving forward, are they running away from the past, merging with the future, or both?</p>

<p>In the first image, we see a view of streets and buildings. This tells a fundamental story at first glance, but if we look closer, this image tells a lot about life and ways of living.</p>

<p>The side buildings in the picture depict the weight of time and the past, and how they gradually change into the future. Further in the picture, we see modern buildings. This reminds us that the future sneaks into our lives every second. So when we close our eyes, we say goodbye to our past and hello to the future.</p>
