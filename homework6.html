    <h2>Reflection</h2>

    <div class="reflection">
        <p>Eyes carry deep emotions, and we can get very creative when portraying emotions through them.  The eyes immediately come to mind when thinking about expression as the most expressive part. For this assignment, I chose to depict the feeling of fear. Fear is very internal and deep; sometimes, people are in situations where they can’t show their fear, but the eyes never lie. In this illustration, I chose a moment of instinctive reaction to danger. I used two primary shapes: the circle and the oval. The ellipse tool was used to create the iris and pupil, and the outer eye was formed by stretching an ellipse into an almond-shaped oval. For the contrast, I chose red and green since they are complementary colors, and I see red as the color of fear. The pupil stays green as the sclera expands into a “red state.” Even though pupils dilate during shock or anxiety,  it almost feels like they remain in a natural state while everything around them changes emotionally. I used two thick lines for the lids, one created with a standard stroke and the other with a brush to introduce subtle contrast in texture.</p>

        <p>After this assignment, I realized how minimal elements can express emotion. I didn’t use any other facial features, yet the eye alone communicated everything. The tension between line weight and color is all that you need to tell a story.</p>
