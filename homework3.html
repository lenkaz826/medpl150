    <h2>Reflection</h2>

    <div class="reflection">
        <p>I chose climate change and war as my topics because they are the most pressing and devastating issues of our time. With climate change, I combined images of people walking through heavy smoke caused by massive pollution in China (Autoevolution Weekly News, 2015), factory smokestacks releasing dark smoke in the air (CBS8), and melting glaciers from Wikimedia Commons. These images speak volumes, and when displayed together, they reveal a clear pattern of one of the leading causes of natural disasters. Climate change is challenging to portray regarding class dynamics and how different social groups experience its effects, but with war, it was much easier to show these differences. I chose images that show contrast between the aggressor and the people who are suffering from the results. Two pictures show the aftermath of the Russian bombing of Georgia in 2008, and the third one shows Vladimir Putin, who has always been part of the aggression and the oppressive side of the world. The images were collected from Wikipedia.</p>

        <p>The techniques I used helped me emphasize the meaning of the cause and guide the viewer’s eye. I used selections to isolate key subjects and moments. Blend modes like Multiply and Overlay fused textures, while Hue/Saturation shifts unified color into dystopian tones. Masking and clipping masks hid or revealed details. Scale, rhythm, and texture emphasized devastation, guiding the viewer’s eye toward chaos in climate and war.</p>
