<h1>Reading Reflections</h1>

<h2>Susan Sontag's On Photography</h2>

<p>The angle on truth, how we recognize what we perceive, and how we deliver the story through photography help me understand what should be remembered and excluded in photography. We humans have different viewpoints on life. People often argue about what is black and white, so how can we capture fragments and claim to show the whole truth? What if our truth is not theirs? Even after all these questions, we conclude that images can always be connected to something personal and find the way to each individual through their stories. Yet our angle can direct those thoughts into what we want them to see.</p>

<p>Our brains lose memories easily, but if documented in a photograph, they can stay with us forever. Yet, when we know that it’s only a fragment, “shadows,” and not reality itself, it reminded me of my class picture, where everyone was smiling at each other and looking delightful, but in fact, many of them despised each other. The image showed something that didn't exist between us. The distortion of reality in photography is an interesting paradox. In this case, we could take this image as an illusion of a happy class or a double-sided face, “masks,” that hide what they actually feel.</p>

<p>What’s the paradox behind always connecting to something personal while seeing an image? Everything we see in an image is real; however, we choose how we want to connect it to our lives. When you see a picture of someone frowning, you might connect that to your memory when you were annoyed by a text message, but the human in the image is frowning because of a sun ray. Does knowing the truth change how you perceive the image or how it made you feel initially? Rarely. Because what you felt was already in the past. If you look at the picture after knowing its whole backstory, it will create a new set of emotions. I love to be mysterious with my images, to leave a broad interpretation to the audience. I don’t curate the truth; I show the moments.</p>

<p>Knowing that each image is a part of a larger story is emotional. We create narratives one by one through single evidence. When I first held a camera in school, I couldn’t think of a plan. I just captured moments, and suddenly, when I looked at them, I saw a huge pattern. I saw a rhythm, and it was beautiful. This showed me how a single image can be turned into a narrative, similar to my future projects that will form a whole story. What I saw was the beginning of our identity and the actual pace of our lives.</p>

<p>In the modern world, we worry that artificiality has changed nature. As Sontag mentions, the oversaturation of images still carries a lot of meaning. There’s so much we can tell and address through photography. And yes, it is personal and powerful, which can distort and connect. I picture daily life and its complexity; I use text and images to bring my ideas to life, and I hope to build a deeper way of representing the world.</p>
