<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>When I think about the human state and nature, images of human-made objects come to mind. Why do we create what we make, and is it good for us or bad? Humans are fascinating creatures, and they love to create chaos, but the aftermath of it is often blurry.</p>

<p>The first images convey how humans can exploit essentials by destroying everything else. Plastic is everywhere, and its debris keeps growing and polluting our environment. We worry about it in our hearts, but the actions tell otherwise. With this week’s assignment, I could picture a little glimpse of it in the center. This was done with a shallow depth of field, keeping the bottle sharp while the background blurred, and with a deep depth of field, showing the subject and background.</p>

<p>With the other two images, I show the nature of two types of chaos. The raw image of the table in the center does not look ideal with the trash on it or the wall that has cracks with the fliers ripped on it, but it tells a story of how things that aren’t perfect can still be delivered as an interesting story with little “filter” on.</p>

<p>Same as the following image, it is dark and confusing; the light in the middle reflects the scratches on the floor, created by humans. But there is a hope with the light. We still have to look forward, even if it seems uncertain or unclear; we must continue walking and fighting. The raw image doesn’t reflect it as much as the photoshopped image. It allowed me to convey those emotions better.</p>
