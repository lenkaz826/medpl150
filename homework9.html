<h2>Reflection</h2>

<div class="reflection">
<p>Eating disorders are a common health issue worldwide, and there are various forms of them. In this case, I wanted to focus on how common it is to have eating disorders in the U.S. The sources I used were gathered from the official websites of the National Eating Association, which provided statistics on eating disorders; the National Institute of Mental Health; and the Journal of Adolescent Health, which featured eating disorder prevalence among nonbinary young adults. Since it’s a very sensitive topic, I didn’t want to dive deeply into different cases. Instead, I focused on my page and its variations. </p>
<p> I created my graph with the column graph tool. When I selected it, I manually entered the data I gathered from official sources, but some of the graphs overlapped, so I used the ungroup method to distinguish them and work on them individually. I chose one of the most commonly used graph shapes and selected different colors for the numbers and titles to make it more visually engaging. Initially, I wanted to use very dark colors, but then I realized I didn’t want to use colors to convey a specific message, so I leaned toward a neutral color palette. It’s not too bright, nor too dark, but something in between and more satisfying for the eye. I also added a new CSS style sheet that included new fonts, colors, margins, and section spacing for my homework 9 page to add more creativity and depth to it.  </p>
