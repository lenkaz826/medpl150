<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>As much as I admire complicated, dramatic interiors, I love simplicity and the idea of how you can find comfort even in simple things. The original image contains just a plain wall and the light that illuminates the room, but I reflected it through warmth. I wanted to show that something can be worth noting even in simple, tiny details of our everyday life. When I saw the initial image, I remembered the room from my countryside house that had the exact same ceiling light, which also awoke nostalgic feelings. It's funny how tiny things can remind you of your experiences.</p> <p>The illustrated version reminds me of a scene from a cartoon, where a character enters the room, lights the bulb, and the camera points to the exact spot of the light, in a 16:9 frame. I imported the original image into Adobe Illustrator. I created layers for each subject, such as wall, bulb, socket, filament, and the shadow. I used a rectangle shape for the wall, and then started building the bulb itself. Two shapes I used were an ellipse and a rectangle. After putting everything in place, I lowered the opacity of the shadow, and I chose three colors from the triad palette to represent the contrast and harmony, which I also used in my second, optional illustration. In the second illustration, I mainly focused on shapes by removing the textures, details, and the balance between light and comfort. </p>
